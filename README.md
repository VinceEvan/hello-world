Figuring out what the hell githubs get-started guide can show me about github.

I'm out of state for an educational program funded by NASA. The scope of the program is to motivate freshman and sophomore college students intending to graduate in a STEM field. Tonight I wanted to study calculus, watch a physics video, and do some educational->career research. Now, I want to do these things in reverse order. I'm not an applied math major. I'm a college freshman <i>interested</i> in an analytical, technical, or information-technology career.
